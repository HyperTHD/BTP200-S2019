Workshop 8: Reflection

1. An abstract class will have one or more method(s) within the class that is declared, but not yet defined. Pure Virtual Functions are examples of this
because they are defined in their derived class and not the base class itself.

A concrete class, however, is a class where the method(s) exists within the class itself without any need of help from a derived class.

2. There were 4 functions that did shadowing:

They were the credit(), debit(), monthEnd(), and display() functions.

The first 2 shadowed the same functions from the Account class.

The second 2 shadowed the same functions from the SavingsAccount class.

3. In this workshop, I learned the following:

- I learned about how abstract classes work, how to create them, how to handle interfaces and defining their functions in their respective derived classes.
I also learned 


Quiz 8 Reflection:

I answered 3 half-correct:

For 2:

- I mentioned that the output prints In Derived, but it also prints In Base

For 3:

- I printed that the constructor for the base and the destructor for the derived were called in this order

- Constructor: Base
- Constructor: Derived
- Destructor: Derived
- Destructor: Base

For 4:

- The answer was template <Type identifier>
