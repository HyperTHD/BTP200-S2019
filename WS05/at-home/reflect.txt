Workshop 5: At-Home

1) The operator+ does not return a reference to a Fraction object because we're not modifying the current object in this example. The operator+= updates the current object 
and so it requires a reference to the current object. In the case of operator+, we're just defining how 2 Fraction objects work with each other and so we need only return a Fraction
object with the total result calculated and not update the current object since we are not making any changes to it.

2) The temporary objects inside the tester module are a, b, and d.

3) I reused functions where needed as well as apply the + operator in the operator+=
function to avoid having to rewrite code for the addition of 2 fraction objects.

Quiz 3 Reflection:

I answered question 1 incorrectly.

For question 1:

- I incorrectly wrote that the keyword for allowing an outside class or function the ability to access the private members of another class was "protected"
The answer was the keyword "friend"
