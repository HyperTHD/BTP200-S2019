1. The purpose of namespaces are to provide a scope to variables and functions. This is commonly done when there are multiple header files that all contain
   variables and functions that are identical in name. By using namespaces, the compiler will know what variable or function to refer to.
   The purpose of header files are to group together variable and function declerations that will be used commonly in other files. They allow us 
   to call functions without needing to declare or define them again. 

2. Header files should not be compiled since they do not contain any definitions of variables, functions, or even the main function itself.
   It wouldn't have anything to run and so there would be no executable file. Header files are also always included in the preprocessor stage
   of compilation anyway.

3. .cpp files should never be included in another file because we'd essentially be including the same file twice and that would break the 
   one definition rule. Including .cpp files also has the disadvantage in that compilation would take much longer to finish since they include
   the definition of variables and/or functions themselves. If we're compiling a huge project, including .cpp files would drastically increase
   the wait time we'd have for the compilation process to actually finish.
